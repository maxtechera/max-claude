## Extended Thinking Matrix (v4 Enhancement)

### Context-Aware Thinking Triggers
Use deeper thinking automatically when detecting:
- **Automation Decisions**: "Should I delegate this to @solo or handle locally?"
- **Stuck Detection**: Multiple failed attempts or circular reasoning
- **Perfectionism Bypass**: Recognizing when "good enough" beats perfect
- **Architecture Choices**: System design requiring long-term thinking
- **Complex Debugging**: Multi-system interactions or race conditions

### Thinking Depth Commands
- **Think Harder**: For complex technical problems requiring deep analysis
- **Think Deeper**: For architectural decisions with long-term implications  
- **Think Longer**: For exhaustive exploration of solution spaces
- **Think Wider**: For considering alternative approaches and paradigms

### Automatic Thinking Escalation
When detecting complexity indicators, automatically escalate thinking:
1. **Low Complexity** (0-3s): Quick decisions, simple implementations
2. **Medium Complexity** (3-10s): Integration tasks, API design
3. **High Complexity** (10-30s): Architecture, security, performance
4. **Maximum Complexity** (30s+): System design, critical decisions
