**Transform Claude Code from a generic assistant into a development solopreneur's command center. Built for developers and technical founders who code, build products, and run businesses simultaneously.**

> 🚀 **Part of the Solo ecosystem** – AI tools built specifically for solopreneurs. Coming soon: solo-gemini, solo-gpt, Solo-Server, and Solo-Cloud.

## 🎯 The Development SoloPreneur Reality

You're not just writing code. You're a **development solopreneur building multiple streams**:

- 💼 Client work (immediate revenue from technical skills)
- 🚀 Personal ventures (building products with your expertise)
- 📺 Content creation (teaching and building audience)
- 🧪 Side projects (exploring new opportunities)

Generic Claude Code doesn't understand this development solopreneur reality. You need an AI that thinks like a technical founder building multiple revenue streams.

## ✨ Enter solo-claude

This is **real-world configuration** from a development solopreneur building actual revenue streams. It transforms Claude into:

- **🔍 Opportunity spotter** that finds monetizable patterns in your technical work
- **📊 Multi-stream tracker** across client work, ventures, and content
- **⚡ Revenue extractor** that turns technical expertise into income opportunities
- **🎯 Business optimizer** that thinks revenue while maintaining technical excellence
- **💰 Technical entrepreneur's** command center that bridges code and business

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Claude Code (latest version)
- macOS, Linux, or WSL
- Basic command line knowledge
- A solopreneur mindset 🚀

### One-Command Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxtechera/solo-claude.git
cd solo-claude

# Basic installation
./install.sh                    # Default: ~/.claude/

# Advanced options
./install.sh --backup          # Backs up existing config first
./install.sh --project         # Project-specific installation
./install.sh --dry-run         # Preview changes before applying
```

**Zero dependencies.** Pure configuration that works immediately with your existing Claude Code setup.

**Note:** After installation, all configuration files are located in `~/.claude/` (your home directory), not in the project directory.

## 💡 Why This Changes Your Technical Entrepreneur Game

### 🔍 **Never Miss Another Revenue Opportunity**

Every solution you build, every problem you solve gets evaluated for business potential:

```bash
/revenue-check          # Hunt monetizable patterns in your technical work
/pattern-value auth     # "Used 6x → Package for $497 or open source for authority"
/startup               # Multi-stream revenue dashboard for technical people
```

### 📊 **Multi-Stream Technical Business Intelligence**

Track and optimize across all your revenue streams:

- **Client work**: Deliver excellence + extract reusable patterns for future revenue
- **Personal ventures**: Build products leveraging your technical expertise
- **Content creation**: Turn technical knowledge into audience and income
- **Side projects**: Explore opportunities while building technical skills

### ⚡ **Technical Entrepreneur Workflow Automation**

Commands built for technical people building businesses:

```bash
/venture-status        # Complete portfolio: client work + ventures + content
/context-sync work     # Switch to client delivery mode
/context-sync ventures # Switch to personal business building mode
/content-roi debugging # "This 2-hour debug session = 50K+ view tutorial"
```

## 🎮 Example Workflows

### Revenue-Aware Morning Startup

```bash
/startup               # Multi-stream revenue + opportunity intelligence
# → "Auth pattern used 6x → Extract for $497 package or open source for authority"

# → "Client architecture request = consulting upsell potential"
/revenue-check         # Today's highest ROI technical work
```

### Pattern Monetization Flow

```bash
/pattern-value carousel-component
# → "Used 4x across projects"
# → "Development time saved: 12 hours × $150/hr = $1,800"
# → "Package potential: $97 React component template"
# → "Content potential: Tutorial could get 25K+ views"
# Action: Extract, package, create content, profit
```

### Multi-Stream Context Switch
